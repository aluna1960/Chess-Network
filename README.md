# Chess-Network
-An application aimed to help new chess players learn piece movements, chess notation, popular chess openings and to practice with computer.

 This application uses flutter so it is dart based. It has flutter stateless chess board, and flutter chess board dependencies.
 The user can choose a "Learn chess" tab where they will be directed to a page where they will learn to play chess; chess piece moves will be taught depending on the tab they choose. Chess notation will also be taught and the user can use the board to make moves and print the moves they are making. There will be a button under the chess board where they will be able to reset the board and start moving chess pieces around to practice by themselves and learn moves. 
 The user will also be able to play against a computer. There was some code that I found where the opposing player which in this case would be a "computer", shuffles random moves. This is very basic and is great for a beginner to train against a computer which can also take your pieces.
 Finally, there is the chess openings page. In this page the user chooses a color (black or white) and popular chess opening will be displayed. The user can then choose an opening and learn the notation and have a little gif animation show the first few moves for the openings.
